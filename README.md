A simple Java-based chatbot application that simulates an interactive assistant. The chatbot takes user input, processes it, and responds with predefined answers. It handles basic conversational queries like greetings, questions about Java, and general inquiries. This project demonstrates basic Java programming, handling user input, and working with data structures like **HashMap**.

## Features:
- **Java-based**: Built using core Java programming.
- **Predefined Responses**: Responds to a range of user queries (e.g., "hi", "how are you?", "what is Java?").
- **Simple Conversational Flow**: Provides users with a basic conversational interface.
- **Extendable**: Easy to add new responses and improve functionality.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The core programming language.
- **HashMap**: Used to store predefined responses.
- **Scanner**: To handle user input via the command line.
